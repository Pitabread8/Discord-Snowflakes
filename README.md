# Discord-Snowflakes

Discord uses Snowflake to generate IDs for accounts, messages, channels, and servers. This website extracts the timestamps from the IDs. You can easily find out how long someone has been on Discord, when a channel/server was created, or when a message was sent.

In order to copy an ID, make sure you have enabled Developer Mode in User Settings > Appearance. Then, right click on the element and choose the Copy ID option.
