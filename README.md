# Discord-Snowflakes

Discord uses Snowflake to generate IDs for accounts, messages, channels, and servers. This website extracts the timestamps from the IDs.

In order to copy an ID, make sure you have enabled Developer Mode in User Settings > Appearance. Then, right click on the element and select the 'Copy ID' option.
